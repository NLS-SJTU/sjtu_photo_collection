2. Take pictures. 200 pics per person, focus on landmark buildings, objects, statues, logos, etc. **Make sure you enabled the positioning functions on your cell phone while taking pictures.** We NEED the `EXIF` positionning information on your picture.
3. Transfer all the pics on your computer in **one** folder, then download the `rename_photos.py` in this repo in the same folder. Run this script with python (it relys on the package `exifread` so maybe you need to run `pip install exifread` first)
4. Copy the entire folder to your teamleader.
